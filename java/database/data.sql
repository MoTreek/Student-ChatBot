  '"At its core, Git is a set of command line utility programs that are designed to execute on a Unix style command-line environment. Modern operating systems like Linux and macOS both include built-in Unix command line terminals. This makes Linux and macOS complementary operating systems when working with Git. Microsoft Windows instead uses Windows command prompt, a non-Unix terminal environment. In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project. Once a projects collaboration requirements grow with other team members, it is critical to be aware of how the actual raw Git methods work. This is when it can be beneficial to drop a GUI version for the command line tools. Git Bash is offered to provide a terminal Git experience."',
